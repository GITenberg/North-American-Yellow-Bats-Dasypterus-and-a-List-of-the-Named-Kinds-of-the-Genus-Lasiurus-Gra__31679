<b>
INTRODUCTION
</b>
</p>
<p>
Yellow bats occur only in the New World and by most recent authors have been referred to the genus
<i>
Dasypterus
</i>
Peters. The red bats and the hoary bat, all belonging to the genus
<i>
Lasiurus
</i>
Gray, also occur only in the New World except that the hoary bat has an endemic subspecies in the Hawaiian Islands.
</p>
<p>
The kind of yellow bat first to be given a distinctive name was the smaller of the two species that occur in North America. It was named
<i>
Nycticejus ega
</i>
in 1856 (p. 73) by Gervais on the basis of material from the state of Amazonas, Brazil, South America, but was early recognized as occurring also in North America (in the sense that M&#233;xico and Central America, including Panam&#225;, are parts of North America). More than 40 years elapsed before subspecific names were proposed for the North American populations; Thomas named
<i>
Dasypterus ega xanthinus
</i>
in 1897 (p. 544) from Baja California, and
<i>
Dasypterus ega panamensis
</i>
in 1901 (p. 246) from Panam&#225;.
</p>
<p>
The larger of the two North American species was named
<i>
Lasiurus intermedius
</i>
in 1862 (p. 246) by H. Allen on the basis of material from extreme northeastern M&#233;xico. Another alleged species,
<i>
Dasypterus floridanus</i>, was named in 1902 (p. 392) by Miller from Florida, but as set forth below it is only a subspecies of
<i>
L. intermedius</i>, a species that is seemingly limited to parts of the North American mainland and Cuba.
</p>
<p>
A third species,
<i>
Atalapha egregia</i>, allegedly allied to the small yellow bat,
<i>
L. ega</i>, was named in 1871 (p. 912) by Peters from Santa Catarina, Brazil, but Handley (1960:473) thinks that
<i>
L. egregius
</i>
is allied instead to the red bats. The species
<i>
L. egregius
</i>
has not been studied in connection with the observations reported below.
</p>
<p>
Bats of the genus concerned were given the generic name
<i>
Nycteris
</i>
by Borkhausen in 1797 (p. 66), and the name
<i>
Lasiurus
</i>
by Gray in 1831 (p. 38). For much of the latter part of the 19th century the generic name
<i>
Atalapha
</i>
proposed by Rafinesque in 1814 (p. 12) was used because it antedated the name
<i>
Lasiurus</i>. In this period Harrison Allen (1894:137) raised to generic rank the name
<i>
Dasypterus
</i>
that had been proposed by Peters in 1871 (p. 912) only as a subgenus for the yellow bats. Since 1894 the yellow bats ordinarily have borne the generic name
<i>
Dasypterus</i>. The red bats and the hoary bat continued to be referred to as of the genus
<i>
Atalapha
</i>
until early in the 20th century when it was decided that a European bat of another genus was technically the basis for the name
<i>
Atalapha</i>. Thereupon
<i>
Lasiurus
</i>
was again used in the belief that it was the earliest available name for the bats concerned. But in 1909 (p. 90) Miller showed that the name
<i>
Lasiurus
</i>
was preoccupied by
<i>
Nycteris
</i>
Borkhausen, 1797 (p. 66). From 1909 until 1914 in conformance with the Law of Priority
<i>
Nycteris
</i>
was used for the red bat and the hoary bat.
</p>
<p>
At this point it is desirable to digress and indicate why and how the Law of Priority came into being. In the 19th century different technical names were used for the same kind of animal depending on the opinions of individual authors. For example, one author used name A because it was most descriptive of the morphology of the animal, another author used name B because it had been used more often than any other, another author used name C because it was more euphonious, etc. In order to achieve uniformity and stability a set of rules was drawn up in 1901 at the International Zoological Congress in Berlin. Those rules were based principally on the rule, or law, of priority. In effect, the law stated that the technical name first given to a kind of animal (with starting date as of January 1, 1758,
<i>
Systema Naturae
</i>
of Linnaeus) would be the correct and official name. After the mentioned rules were adopted, some zoologists, mostly non-taxonomists, objected to the rules and in response to these objections a compromise was adopted in 1913 at the International Zoological Congress in Monaco and the International Committee on Zoological Nomenclature was authorized to set aside, at its discretion, the Law of Priority. In 1913 it was thought by everyone that the names conserved (<i>nomina conservanda</i>) by setting aside the rules would be few.
</p>
<p>
Returning now to the generic names applied to the bats concerned, it is to be noted that from 1803 until 1909
<i>
Nycteris
</i>
had been used as the generic name of an African bat on the erroneous assumption that the name was first applied in a valid fashion to the African bat. With the aim of conserving the name
<i>
Nycteris
</i>
for the African bat, some zoologists petitioned the International Committee on Zoological Nomenclature to set aside the Law of Priority and petitioned also that the name
<i>
Lasiurus
</i>
be validated for use again as the generic name for New World bats. This petition was granted in 1914 in the first lot of names for which exception to the rules was made. As a result, since 1914
<i>
Lasiurus
</i>
has been used with increasing frequency, and
<i>
Nycteris
</i>
with decreasing frequency, for New World bats.
</p>
<p>
The above explanation of the application of the generic names
<i>
Nycteris</i>,
<i>
Atalapha</i>, and
<i>
Lasiurus
</i>
is given for two reasons: First, study of more abundant material than was available to Harrison Allen in 1894 when he raised
<i>
Dasypterus
</i>
to generic rank reveals, as set forth beyond, that the yellow bats are not generically different from the red bats and hoary bat and so will bear the same generic name that is applied to the red bat and hoary bat; second, a choice of generic names has to be made. Actually, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature since 1913 has voted to make many, instead of only a few, exceptions to the rules. The number of names resulting from these exceptions is becoming so large that some zoologists fear that the chaotic condition of nomenclature in the previous century will return. Those who hold such fears maintain that adherence to the rules of 1901, or to the Law of Priority, or at least to some rules, clearly is desirable. Certainly there is much logic in that view. According to the rules,
<i>
Nycteris
</i>
is the correct name of the bats concerned. According to the Commission, it is well to use instead the name
<i>
Lasiurus</i>. Perhaps the time has come to follow the rules and use
<i>
Nycteris</i>. But, because of the possibility that the Commission will return to its policy of 1913 and recommend only a few instead of many exceptions to the rules, the generic name
<i>
Lasiurus
</i>
is tentatively used in the following accounts.

Distribution and Geographic Variation
</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
Lasiurus intermedius
</i>
H. Allen, type from Matamoros, Tamaulipas, has been reported from the Rio Grande Valley of Texas southward to Honduras and in Cuba.
<i>
Lasiurus floridanus
</i>
(Miller), type from Lake Kissimmee, Florida, has been recorded from southeastern Texas, eastward along the Gulf of Mexico to Florida, and thence northward along the Atlantic Coast to extreme southeastern Virginia (see records of occurrence beyond and Fig. 2). Specimens of
<i>
intermedius
</i>
from the vicinity of the type locality and from other localities in M&#233;xico differ from specimens of
<i>
floridanus
</i>
(from Florida and southern Georgia) as follows: Larger, both externally (especially forearm) and cranially (see measurements); teeth larger and heavier; skull heavier and having more prominent sagittal and lambdoidal crests; braincase less rounded, more elongate; auditory bullae relatively smaller; upper parts averaging brighter (yellowish to yellowish-orange in general aspect, rather than yellowish-brown to brownish-gray).
</p>
<p>
The differences mentioned above are of the magnitude of those that ordinarily separate subspecies of a single species rather than two species. Miller (1902:392-393), in the original description of
<i>
floridanus</i>, noted that the differences between it and
<i>
intermedius
</i>
were slight and remarked (p. 393): "Indeed, it is probable that it intergrades with the Texas animal." Lowery (1936:17) also has suggested that intergradation might occur between
<i>
intermedius
</i>
and
<i>
floridanus
</i>
"in southwestern Louisiana or eastern Texas"; later (1943:223-224) he pointed out that specimens from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, averaged larger in cranial dimensions than typical
<i>
floridanus
</i>
and again mentioned the possibility of intergradation between the two kinds. Sanborn (1954:25-26) touched obliquely on the problem when he wrote: "In Florida,
<i>
Dasypterus intermedius
</i>
is referred to as a Florida yellow bat (<i>Dasypterus floridanus</i>)." Handley (1960:478) wrote that certain morphological similarities suggested "gene flow" between the two kinds.
</p>
<p>
Specimens examined from Louisiana resemble
<i>
floridanus
</i>
from Georgia and Florida to the eastward in external dimensions. Some of those specimens resemble
<i>
floridanus
</i>
in size of skull, but two skulls from Louisiana are inseparable from those of topotypes of
<i>
intermedius</i>. The upper parts of specimens from Louisiana are generally like those of animals to the east but average somewhat paler (less brownish). The specimens seen from Louisiana seem to be intergrades between
<i>
intermedius
</i>
and
<i>
floridanus
</i>
but clearly are assignable to the latter.

The picture is less clear as regards bats from southeastern Texas (one specimen each from Colorado and Travis counties, and four specimens from Harris County). Five of the specimens have skulls (the Travis County specimen is a skin only) and of these, four are clearly assignable, on the basis of size and shape of the skull, to
<i>
intermedius</i>. The fifth skull (specimen from Colorado County) is intermediate in size between
<i>
floridanus
</i>
and
<i>
intermedius
</i>
and on that basis alone could be assigned with equal propriety to either. All these specimens from Texas more closely resemble
<i>
floridanus
</i>
than
<i>
intermedius
</i>
in external size (forearms: 49.2, 49.6, 50.7, 49.9 (approximate), 49.6, 49.1). The pale yellowish-gray upper parts of the four adults, seemingly resulting from a dilution of the brownish color found in
<i>
floridanus</i>, differ from the color of typical specimens of both
<i>
intermedius
</i>
and
<i>
floridanus</i>, but the average is nearer that of
<i>
floridanus
</i>
than that of
<i>
intermedius</i>. Color of pre-adult pelage in the one July-taken young of the year resembles the color of adults. An August-taken young of the year is in process of acquiring the adult pelage but the hairs have not reached their full growth; it is pale yellowish but not so grayish as the other specimens. All characters considered, the specimens from eastern Texas resemble
<i>
floridanus
</i>
more than they do
<i>
intermedius</i>, and so are provisionally assigned to
<i>
floridanus
</i>
(as was done by Taylor and Davis, 1947:19; Eads,
<i>
et al.</i>, 1956:440; and, Davis, 1960:59). Additional material from southeastern Texas is needed. It will be remembered that the type locality of
<i>
intermedius
</i>
is in the Rio Grande Valley; all specimens seen, in the study here reported on, from the Texas side of the valley are unquestionably referable to that subspecies.
</p>
<p>
Intergradation, then, occurs between
<i>
L. intermedius
</i>
and
<i>
L. floridanus
</i>
in some degree in southern Louisiana and in more marked degree in southeastern Texas. Specimens from the area of intergradation vary more individually in many features than do specimens from other areas. In general the intergrades tend to resemble
<i>
floridanus
</i>
in small size externally and
<i>
intermedius
</i>
in large size of skull. The specimens from southeastern Texas differ from typical specimens of both subspecies in color, being pale yellowish-gray (instead of yellowish to yellowish-orange as in
<i>
intermedius
</i>
or yellowish brown to brownish-gray as in
<i>
floridanus</i>), and this difference is shared to some extent with animals from Louisiana, the latter being somewhat intermediate between bats from Texas and those from Florida and Georgia, although nearer those from Florida and Georgia.
</p>
<p>
An hypothesis to account for the variation noted is that in Wisconsin Time, and perhaps in earlier Pleistocene times, this yellow bat was (as it is now) a warmth-adapted animal as Blair (1959:461) would term it. Some cool period forced the mainland populations of the two species into two refugia&#8212;peninsular Florida and eastern M&#233;xico&#8212;and the present area of intergradation is, therefore, of a secondary rather than a primary type. Possibly also the relatively treeless area of part of southern Texas has made for a sparse population there of
<i>
Lasiurus intermedius
</i>
and gene flow now may be, and long may have been, slight between the eastern and southern segments of the species.
</p>
<p>
It could be contended that the peculiar coloration of specimens from southeastern Texas, coupled with the tendency to have a large skull (as has
<i>
intermedius</i>) and small external dimensions (as has
<i>
floridanus</i>), justifies subspecific recognition for the animals that here are termed intergrades. But, judging by the specimens now available, such subspecific recognition would tend to obscure rather than clarify the geographic variation noted.

<i>
Life History
</i>
</p>
<p>
Probably bats of the species
<i>
Lasiurus intermedius
</i>
seek retreats primarily in trees (see Moore, 1949<i>a</i>:59-60) but Baker and Dickerman (1956:443) reported "approximately 45 yellow bats" concealed on July 22, 1955, "among dried corn stalks hanging from the sides of a large open tobacco shed" in the state of Veracruz. Young are born in late spring, three being the only number known except that Davis (1960:59) was told that in the vicinity of Mission, Texas, two was the usual number "born in May and June." Sherman (1945:194) reported a female with young (number not given) taken on June 7, 1918, at Seven Oaks, Florida, and another with three young taken on June 20, 1941, at Ocala, Florida. Lowery (1936:17) recorded a female, having three young, obtained on June 17, 1932, at Baton Rouge, Louisiana. A specimen taken on May 19, 1940, at Baton Rouge contained three embryos. Baker and Dickerman (<i>loc. cit.</i>) reported four adult females from Veracruz as lactating on July 22, 1955, but they were accompanied by flying young of the year and probably were near the end of the lactation period. Among specimens examined, juveniles are available by date as follows: 5 mi. N Baton Rouge, Louisiana (June 26, 1953); Palm Beach, Florida (July 6, 1950); and Izamal, Yucat&#225;n ("taken with mother" on July 28, 1910). Breeding probably takes place in autumn and winter; Sherman (<i>op. cit.</i>:196) reported males from Florida as sexually "mature" from the beginning of September to mid-February. Late winter segregation of sexes has been reported.

In the following accounts, localities of occurrence in each state are listed from north to south; if two lie in the same latitude, the westernmost is listed first. Localities that are italicized are not shown on the distribution map (Fig. 2), either because undue crowding of symbols would result or, in several cases, because we could not precisely place the localities. Length of forearm is the average of both forearms in individuals in which both forearms could be measured.

From

of the adjacent Floridan mainland,

differs in many of the same ways that it differs from
<i>
L. i. intermedius</i>, except that the differences are even more trenchant because

is smaller than
<i>
intermedius</i>. Indeed, the difference in size between

<i>
Remarks.</i>&#8212;Four of the five specimens on which the name
<i>
L. i. insularis
</i>
is based differ to such a degree from mainland populations of the species
<i>
L. intermedius
</i>
that specific rather than subspecific recognition for the Cuban bat might seem warranted. It is because of the fifth specimen (USNM 254714) that we accord subspecific rank to
<i>
insularis</i>. It is smaller than the other Cuban specimens and except for longer condylocanine length, longer mandibular tooth-rows, narrower interorbital region, and heavier dentition is indistinguishable in measurements from the largest specimens of
<i>
L. i. intermedius
</i>
from the mainland. In addition, it appears not to have the enormously developed sagittal crest of the other specimens of
<i>
insularis
</i>
although posteriorly the dorsal part of the skull (where the crest is most prominent) is missing. USNM 254714 agrees with the other Cuban specimens in having the mesostyle of M1 and M2 somewhat reduced and in having a small M3 on which the cingulum and second commissure are poorly developed, and this specimen is regarded as representative of the lower size limits of the Cuban population.

Thomas (1901:246), based on three specimens from R&#237;o Cauquete, R&#237;o Cauca, Colombia, as a synonym of
<i>
Dasypterus ega panamensis
</i>
Thomas (<i>loc. cit.</i>) that was based on a specimen from Bogava, 250 meters elevation, Chiriqu&#237;, Panam&#225;. The latter name has line priority over
<i>
fuscatus</i>. Cabrera (1958:116) remarked that: "Las diferencias que Thomas se&#241;al&#243; entre el
<i>
Dasypterus
</i>
de Panam&#225; y el de Colombia (<i>fuscatus</i>) nos parecen estar dentro de los l&#237;mites de la variaci&#243;n individual, siendo adem&#225;s muy raro que una especie de quir&#243;ptero este representada en Colombia y en Panam&#225; por razas diferentes."
</p>
<p>
On July 16, 1958, at the British Museum of Natural History, one of us (Hall) examined the holotypes of
<i>
panamensis
</i>
and
<i>
fuscatus</i>, as well as other materials used by Thomas, and readily perceived the differences that he pointed out. Thomas' description, although terse, is accurate.
<i>
L. e. fuscatus
</i>
is much more blackish than
<i>
panamensis</i>. We are inclined to retain the two names as applicable to two subspecies. Whether or not
<i>
fuscatus
</i>
is synonymized under
<i>
panamensis</i>, the holotype of
<i>
panamensis
</i>
is an intergrade between the almost black Colombian animal (<i>fuscatus</i>) and the paler individuals in Central America and territory north thereof. Even so, the holotype of
<i>
panamensis
</i>
more closely resembles the blackish Colombian population than the paler populations to the north and the name
<i>
panamensis</i>, therefore, is correctly applicable to the bat from Panam&#225;, but not to bats of the species
<i>
Lasiurus ega
</i>
from farther north as most authors (see, for example, Hall and Kelson, 1959:194, map 143; and Handley, 1960:474) suggested was the case. For the populations north of Panam&#225; the name
<i>
Lasiurus ega xanthinus
</i>
(Thomas) (1897:544) needs to be used.

RELATIONS BETWEEN THE SPECIES OF LASIURUS
</b>
</p>
<p>
As suggested by Dalquest in 1953 (p. 62) and by Handley in 1959 (p. 119) and 1960 (p. 473), the yellow bats,
<i>
Lasiurus ega
</i>
(Gervais) and
<i>
Lasiurus intermedius
</i>
H. Allen, so closely resemble the hoary bat,
<i>
Lasiurus cinereus
</i>
(Palisot de Beauvois), and the red bats,
<i>
Lasiurus borealis
</i>
(M&#252;ller) and the seven related species listed below, that all are properly included in a single genus. Many of the common characteristics are enumerated above in the diagnosis of the genus (see also Handley, 1960:473).
</p>
<div class="figcenter">

</span>
Diagram of bones of right arm and third finger (middle digit) including cartilage on distal end of terminal (3rd) phalanx. Percentages are in terms of the over-all length of the arm and third finger.
</p>
<p>
A listing of the differences between the species is less impressive than a listing of the resemblances. The yellow bats differ less from the red bats than does the hoary bat,
<i>
L. cinereus</i>, which differs from all of the others as follows: talonid on m3 larger; p4 single-rooted instead of double-rooted; hypocone on M1 and M2 smaller; coronoid process lower; ossified part of tympanic ring, which shields the petrosal, larger; humerus relatively shorter; forearm relatively longer; first phalanx of middle finger relatively shorter; presternum including keel longer than wide instead of
<i>
vice versa</i>. The differences in the sternum and proportions of the forelimb reflect the more rapid flight of the hoary bat. The yellow bats differ from the red bats and hoary bat in long rostrum, pronounced sagittal crest, high coronoid process, absence of the first upper premolar, long first phalanx of the third digit and short terminal (3rd) phalanx of the same digit. Features in which the red bats are extreme in the genus are short rostrum, short forearm, and relatively longer second phalanx of the third finger. The red bats differ only slightly one from another.
</p>
<p>
Next to nothing is known of extinct Tertiary ancestors of species of the genus
<i>
Lasiurus</i>. Also relatively little is known about
<i>
Lasiurus
</i>
in the Pleistocene. Consequently, evolution of the living species has to be inferred almost entirely from what is known about their structure, habits, and geographic distribution. Figure 4 presents some ideas concerning relationships.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
